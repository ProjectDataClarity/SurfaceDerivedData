<p>Real-time data exchange amongst different stakeholders during the drilling of a well is important for broader adoption of drilling automation solutions. A lot of such data on a drilling rig is derived; i.e., calculated from core sensor measurements. Currently, derived data calculations are not well documented or standardized; thus it cannot be confidently used by parties other than those who create them. The objective of this work is to help remove this barrier.</p>

<p>We focus on nine commonly used derived data quantities: bit depth, hole depth (measured depth and true vertical depth), rate of penetration (time based and depth based), weight on bit, stick slip index, calculated flow in, and time to depth conversion and identify the metadata required to fully understand them. We identify the metadata by implementing, testing, and comparing the various calculation alternatives for each of the above mentioned derived data quantities, and through discussions within, but not limited to the SPE Drilling Systems Automation Technical Sections (DSATS) Data Quality Assurance (DQA) group.  </p>

<p>This project provides metadata guidelines to enable multiple stakeholders on a drilling project to effectively share and use derived data in real-time with confidence. </p>
